<p align="center">This is a high resolution image of Active Region 953 on the sun. It was taken on 4-27-07 in white light and represents
	a region on the sun full of activity. The black spot is where the sun is about 1000 degrees cooler than its surroundings. The sun is
	at the minimum of an 11 year cycle. This spot is the first in over three weeks.</p>

<p>A special solar filter was used for this and all sun photos. Never look at or try to photograph the sun without one! Your eyes and your
	camera will forever be damaged if you do. </p>
