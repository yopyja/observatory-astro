    <p>When stars are new to middle aged such as our own,  the core fuses hydrogen through a process called the Proton-proton chain reaction. This process takes place in low to stellar mass stars. This occurs when two protons colliding with enough energy to fuse together. Once fused, this creates a Deuteron (hydrogen atom comprised of a proton and a neutron) and releases a neutrino as well as an electron and positron which in turn create a pair of gamma rays. Once more, the Deuteron collides with another proton creating a ionized Helieum-3 atom (a helium atom with one neutron and 2 protons) and releases another gamma ray. When these two Helium atoms collide and fuse, you can obtain Berryllium-6 which in turn decays to two protons and a Helium atom.</p></font></td>
    <td valign="top"><p align="center"><font color="#33FFFF">In stars larger than our sun, the dominant fusion process in the core is called the Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen Cycle (CNO Cycle). This process uses existing, small amounts of heavier elements as a catalyst for the fusion of hydrogen. The process begins by the capture of a proton by a Carbon-12 atom which emits a gamma ray creating a Nitrogen-13 atom. The N-13 atom Beta decays (release of an electron or positron) into a C-13 atom. The C-13 atom captures a proton and emits a gamma ray creating a N-14 atom. The N-14 atom captures another proton forming an Oxygen-15 atom which Beta decays into a N-15 atom. The N-15 atom Alpha decays (release of a helium nucleus) and forms C-12 once again. This cycles over and over again until the core mass dwindles enough to create stop the fusion process.</font></td>

    <p>Since stars do have a finite amount of material to fuse, there is a limit to how long they live. As the star burns through its hydrogen, it begins to fuse helium in the core (a fast process called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium_flash">Helium Flash</a>) and shells of hydrogen outside of the core. At this point, the star inflates and becomes a giant or supergiant depending on size. As the star continues burning through Helium, Beryllium, Carbon and Oxygen, the core contracts and expands through each of the fusion processes. Only stars more massive than our Sun (approx. 8x our sun's mass) can fuse elements higher than Helium.</p>
    <p>As the Star burns through more Helium, it expands into an Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) star and begins to vary its size and brightness as different shells of hydrogen and helium are burned and helium flashes occur. The core of the star is becoming more unstable as time goes on. Interestingly, the Helium burning shells in the star can begin synthesizing heavier elements due to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_capture">neutron capture</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_decay">beta decay</a> to produce elements as large as Bismuth-83. Also, Carbon and Oxygen are transported from inside the star to the outer atmosphere due to powerful convection currents. </p></font></td>
    <td align="center" valign="top"><font color="#33FFFF"><font size="+1">High Mass Stars:</font> 
    <p>Stars with greater mass than our Sun (greater then 5 solar masses) begin by burning helium in the core much like a solar mass star but since there is more mass, there is more gravitational energy to further the process through Iron. As Helium runs out in the core, it collapses until the outward pressure of the fusion of Carbon can withstand the inward force of gravity. Then the star's core collapses more and more as the heavier elements are fused. More energy (provided by the force of gravity on the core) is needed to burn heavier and heavier elements until Iron is reached. At this point, there is not enough energy to fuse Iron. Massive stars such as these have life spans of millions to just a couple billion years unlike that of solar mass and smaller stars which have life spans of tens of billions of years.</p></font></td>
    <td align="center" valign="top"><font color="#33FFFF"><font size="+1">The Final Death:</font>
    <p>For solar mass stars, the core will produce a number of helium flashes as it fuses through its remaining fuel. At some point, these helium flashes increase in intensity and will push off the outer layers of the star's atmosphere into space creating a "Planetary Nebula". This name is a misnomer due to astronomers thinking these were distant planets before they were found to be nebula created by dying stars. There is nothing left over except for the dense hot core of the star that has ceased its fusion processes. This leftover core is called a White Dwarf.</p>
    <p>As the large mass star fuses through the slew of elements ending at Iron, the core runs out of energy due to Iron needing energy to fuse it instead of being able to release energy when fused. When the core stops fusing at Iron, it collapses due to the loss of outward pressure and becomes overwhelmed with the inward force of gravity. The very fast collapse of the core causes the outer layers to collapse also, but these outer layers hit the core of the star and bounce off with immense force. Energy is release in the form of neutrinos, light, and heat as the outer layers of the star are blown outward from the core. Depending on the size of the initial star and how much material was left over, the core collapses into a Neutron Star or a Black Hole.</p></font></td>

    <p>The surface temperature of these stars is approximately 20,000&#176;K. This heat is from the left over heat of the fusion processes in the old core. There is no fusion process inside the leftover core. The size of a white dwarf is approximately the same size as the earth with about 100,000x the gravity and 200,000x the density (if the radius is similar to Earth). There is a limit to the mass (1.4 solar masses also called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandrasekhar_Limit">Chandrasekhar Limit</a>) of a white dwarf before the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_degeneracy_pressure">electron degeneracy pressure</a> is overtaken by gravity which gives us a limit to the size of a star that can create it.  </p>

    <td align="center" valign="top"><font color="#33FFFF"><p>Neutron stars are the left overs of stars with initial masses estimated to be 8-20 times the mass of the sun. When the star finally supernovas, the left over mass in the core needs to be above the 1.4 solar mass limit of the white dwarf. Instead of being a ball of left over carbon or oxygen atoms, the electrons interact with the protons and form neutrons through the process of electron capture. This in turn creates a massive ball of neutrons with a radius of about 10 Km (6.2 mi) and with a gravitational pull of 1 Trillion times that of Earth on its surface.</p>
    <p>When the core collapses, the angular velocity of the rotation of the star is conserved in the core. Since the size of the core is decreased dramatically, the rotation of the neutron star is increased immensely. Some are known to spin hundreds of times per second. We have seen this as a result of pulsars such as that in the middle of the Crab Nebula.  Pulsars are neutron stars which have conserved the magnetic field within the core which causes a jet of radio energy to be ejected from the neutron star. See the video below to watch the surrounding gas move as a result of the pulsar in the Crab Nebula.</p>
    <p>There are several forms of neutron stars which include pulsars, magnetars, binary neutron stars, soft gamma repeaters, and anomalous X-ray pulsars.</p>

Stars with an initial mass greater than 8 solar masses will more than likely turn into a black hole at its death. A star will go through similar processes before its death as a neutron star but the mass left over will be great enough to overcome the neutron degeneracy pressure holding a neutron star from collapsing. This occurs with a core mass greater than about 3.2 solar masses. As the pressure increases beyond that holding neutrons apart, one possibility is the neutrons are squeezed tighter to form a ball of quarks. The smallest particle known to science (outside of the string theory of them being made of 1-D strings). Inside the black hole is a region of infinite density where time has theoretically stopped. You can think of this as an absence of space and time. The size of the singularity in the black hole can be calculated using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius">Schwarzschild Radius formula</a>. Beyond the singularity out to a distance called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon">event horizon</a>, nothing can escape due to the gravity being so great.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#33FFFF">Black holes can still grow if given mass to intake. Much of the mass from a star or nebula that comes too close to a black hold may actually be ejected away from the black hole before being sucked in. We can see this happening around super-massive black holes in galaxies with large relativistic jets flowing away from them.</font></p><font color="#33FFFF">
    <p>Black holes theoretically do not last forever. Theories suggest that they may "evaporate" into space by the release of thermal radiation into space. This is referred to as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation">Hawking Radiation</a>.</p></font></td>

This term is incorrect due to the nebula having nothing to do with planets (except for a possibility of it expanding outward past them and affecting them in some manner) and being misidentified by early astronomers. A more correct name for this would be a death star nebula or a ghost star. The material is heated up by its release and also due to the radiation of light interacting with it from the white dwarf.

When they actively intake matter or destroy stars, some of this material is sent away from it in the form of powerful jets of energy seen in radio, X-ray, optical, and gamma ray. It is theorized that most massive galaxies have these super-massive black holes.</font></p><font color="#33FFFF">
