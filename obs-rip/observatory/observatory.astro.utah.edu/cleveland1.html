<p align="center">This is a 1583 sec. exposure of the south sky as seen from Cleveland Lake, Utah.

	The bright yellows and oranges in the photo is caused by scattered light in the atmosphere

	from nearby towns. This is a problem for observatories wanting to do research because it drowns

	out the light from objects in space.</p>
